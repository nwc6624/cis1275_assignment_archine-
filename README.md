# README for CIS 1275 - C++ Programming I

## Overview
This repository contains materials and assignments from the CIS 1275 - C++ Programming I course, which I completed in 2020. This course provided a comprehensive introduction to structured programming techniques, logic, and control using C++. Key topics covered include data types, variables, arithmetic operations, control statements, basic functions, pointers, arrays, structures, and object-oriented concepts.


## Course Information
- **Course Code:** CIS 1275
- **Title:** C++ Programming I
- **Credits:** 3.000 (3.000 Lecture hours, 1.000 Lab hour)
